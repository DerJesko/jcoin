## Plans
I want to implement the following ideas
[ ] Bitcoin style cryptocurrency
[ ] Replace the linked list (blockchain) by a directed acyclic graph (block grid)
[ ] Try to do it more private
[ ] Proof of stake
[ ] proof of space
[ ] some mechanism s.t. one doesn't have to store and validate the entire chain
