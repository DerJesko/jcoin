## Plans
I want to implement the following ideas
- [ ] Bitcoin style cryptocurrency
- [ ] Replace the linked list (blockchain) by a directed acyclic graph (block grid)
- [ ] Try to do it more private (Monero)[https://www.getmonero.org/resources/research-lab/]
- [ ] Proof of stake (Ethereum)[https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/] (Algorand)[https://www.algorand.com/technology/white-papers]
- [ ] proof of space (Chia)[https://www.chia.net/greenpaper/]
- [ ] some mechanism s.t. one doesn't have to store and validate the entire chain
